		Welcome to Wild Safari Consultants! My name is Candice Rakganya, and I'm a passionate 23-year-old founder dedicated to sharing the wonders of the African wilderness with the world. Raised just outside Hoedspruit, a stone's throw from the majestic Kruger National Park, I grew up surrounded by breathtaking landscapes and diverse wildlife, igniting my love for nature from an early age. With a deep commitment to conservation and responsible tourism, I aim to create unforgettable safari experiences that connect you with the beauty of South Africaâ€™s natural heritage while promoting sustainable practices to protect it for future generations. Join me on this incredible journey into the wild!
